;;; Commentary:

;; This is a simple package that allows Emacs users to compete on [VimGolf][1]
;; using the One True Editor. Competition can be commenced utilizing `M-x
;; vimgolf`. When finished with a challenge, `C-c C-v C-c` should finish your
;; editing, ensure correctness, and submit your score and keystrokes to
;; [VimGolf][1].
;;
;; On second thought, let's not go to Camelot. It's a silly place.
;;
;; Patches and Issues are accepted at https://github.com/timvisher/vimgolf
;;
;; [1]: http://vimgolf.com/

;;; Installation:

;; Use melpa

;; I make no guarantees that vimgolf.el works with anything but the latest
;; version of Emacs.
