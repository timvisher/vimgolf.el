;;; Commentary:

;; This is a simple package that allows Emacs users to compete on
;; [VimGolf][1] using the One True Editor. Competition can be commenced
;; utilizing `M-x vimgolf`. When finished with a challenge, `C-c C-v C-c`
;; should finish your editing, ensure correctness, and submit your score
;; and keystrokes to [VimGolf][1].
;;
;; On second thought, let's not go to Camelot. It's a silly place.
;;
;; Patches and Issues are accepted at
;; https://github.com/timvisher/vimgolf.el
;;
;; [1]: https://vimgolf.com/

;;; Installation:

;; Use MELPA Stable, preferably.

;; I make no guarantees that vimgolf.el works with anything but the latest
;; version of Emacs.
